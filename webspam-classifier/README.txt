This is the project I worked on for my Web Mining course at IUB. Here's the abstract of the final project report we submitted:

With a growing popularity of social bookmarking sites and also due to the community structure of bookmarking sites, spammers found new techniques to attack the web. To retain the benefits of sharing one’s web content, spam – discovery mechanisms that can face the flexible strategies of spammers need to be developed. In this paper we use a supervised learning approach to build a classifier that detects user spam. We explore various relationships between tags, bookmarks and users to detect spammers’ activity. We will present features considering this semantic-behavior and user activity. The dataset used is a snapshot of Social Bookmarking system BibSonomy?. For classification we are using an open source SVM library libsvm. Our results present a starting point of how we can detect spam in social bookmarking sites.
